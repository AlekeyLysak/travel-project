        desc:['lake history...','1899','Walter Wilcox was a Yale college student whose passion was the wild beauty of the Rocky Mountains. Hired by explorer Tom Wilson to help map the area around Lake Louise, Wilcox set out in August 1899 in search of a new route up Mount Temple. For two days he endured rain and snow, but on the third day the sky cleared. Invigorated by the sun, Wilcox hiked up the valley to the top of a pile of rocks.','There he discovered a splendid sight – “a narrow, secluded valley with a small lake enclosed by wild rugged precipices… one of the most beautiful lakes I have ever seen.','Wilcox named it Moraine Lake after the moraine, or rock pile, deposited by the Wenkchemna Glacier. He was later to write that, “no scene had ever given me an equal impression of inspiring solitude and rugged grandeur”, adding that his time spent contemplating the view was the happiest half-hour of his life.', 'The next year, Tom Wilson cut a trail from Lake Louise to Moraine Lake. In 1902, the Canadian Pacific Railway constructed a trail of it’s own and before long a carriage road was built. A teahouse was established at the site as early as 1908. The CPR built a new teahouse in 1912 and three enterprising women – Miss EileenStrick, Miss Barbara Dodds and Miss Marjorie Danks – established tent facilities and a log cabin refreshment and souvenir stand. In 1922, the women built four sleeping cabins. By this time, a proper road had been constructed and opened to the public. The original teahouse was replaced and additional cabins were built in 1923, 1939 and 1941.','Moraine Lake is only accessible during the summer months, usually from late May to early October, due to heavy snowfall in the winter that makes the road impassable. Visitors can drive to the lake, but parking is limited and often fills up early in the day, especially during peak tourist season. There is also a shuttle service available from the nearby town of Lake Louise.','There are several hiking trails in the area, ranging from easy walks to more challenging hikes. The most popular trail is the Rockpile Trail, which offers stunning views of the lake and the surrounding mountains from its summit. Other popular trails include the Larch Valley Trail and the Sentinel Pass Trail, both of which offer incredible panoramic views of the surrounding wilderness.','Fishing is allowed in the lake, with a valid fishing permit, and there are opportunities for canoeing and kayaking as well. Swimming is not permitted due to the cold water temperature, which rarely rises above 10 degrees Celsius.Overall, Moraine Lake is a must-see destination for anyone visiting Banff National Park. Its natural beauty and stunning scenery make it one of the most photographed lakes in Canada, and indeed the world.'],

        desc:['construction history...','1632','The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.It is estimated to have cost the equivalent of around 827 million dollars in todays currency.','The mausoleum itself is made of white marble and is adorned with intricate carvings and calligraphy. The main entrance to the Taj Mahal is through the Great Gate, which is also made of white marble and is adorned with calligraphy and geometric patterns. As you approach the mausoleum, you will see four minarets that stand at the corners of the platform on which the Taj Mahal stands.','The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. One such genius planning is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre, which added rich depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best examples of raised tomb variety. The tomb is further raised on a square platform with the four sides of the octagonal base of the minarets extended beyond the square at the corners. The top of the platform is reached through a lateral flight of steps provided in the centre of the southern side. The ground plan of the Taj Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the octagonal tomb chamber in the centre, encompassed by the portal halls and the four corner rooms. The plan is repeated on the upper floor. The exterior of the tomb is square in plan, with chamfered corners. The large double storied domed chamber, which houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, is a perfect octagon in plan. The exquisite octagonal marble lattice screen encircling both cenotaphs is a piece of superb workmanship. It is highly polished and richly decorated with inlay work. The borders of the frames are inlaid with precious stones representing flowers executed with wonderful perfection. The hues and the shades of the stones used to make the leaves and the flowers appear almost real. The cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal is in perfect centre of the tomb chamber, placed on a rectangular platform decorated with inlaid flower plant motifs. The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is greater than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more than thirty years later by the side of the latter on its west. The upper cenotaphs are only illusory and the real graves are in the lower tomb chamber (crypt), a practice adopted in the imperial Mughal tombs.','Inside the Taj Mahal, you will find the tombs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. The tombs are made of white marble and are intricately decorated with precious stones and inlaid carvings. The tombs are surrounded by a decorative screen made of marble, which is delicately carved with floral patterns.','The Taj Mahal is not just a beautiful structure; it is also a symbol of love and devotion. The love story of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal is legendary. They were married for 19 years, and Mumtaz Mahal was Shah Jahans favorite wife. She died during the birth of their 14th child. Shah Jahan was devastated by her death and decided to build a monument to her memory. The Taj Mahal is a testament to his love for her and his desire to honor her in death.','The Taj Mahal is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of visitors from all over the world each year. The Indian government has taken steps to preserve the monument, including limiting the number of visitors and implementing conservation measures to protect the building from pollution and other environmental factors.','In conclusion, the Taj Mahal is not just a beautiful structure, but it is also a symbol of love and devotion. Its exquisite beauty and perfect symmetry are a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the artisans who built it. It is a must-see destination for anyone visiting India and is sure to leave a lasting impression on all who visit.'],

In appearance the Asian sphinx differed from its Egyptian model most noticeably in the addition of wings to the leonine body, a feature that continued through its subsequent history in Asia and the Greek world. Another innovation was the female sphinx, which first began to appear in the 15th century BCE.

The beach is surrounded by towering white cliffs and is home to a shipwreck that has become an iconic symbol of the island. The shipwreck, which is believed to be a smugglers vessel, has been stranded on the beach since 1980 and adds to the beachs unique and mysterious atmosphere.','In addition to its beautiful scenery, Navagio Beach offers visitors a range of activities, including swimming, sunbathing, and snorkeling. Many visitors also choose to take a boat tour of the surrounding area to explore the nearby caves and other beaches.Visiting Navagio by boat is a must on Zakynthos but it cannot be compared to the view revealed from edge of the cliffs above. Seeing the beach from the sea and from the cliff top is like seeing two different places and the best is if you can do both.Once on Zakynthos, there is no chance to miss the offers for boat trip to Navagio, they are everywhere around you. Some of them are full-day cruises which tour around the island and the Shipwreck beach is part of their program. They are good if you want to see the entire island cove and the Blue Caves but if Navagio is your purpose, these trips may disappoint you because: You will have just 15-20 minutes on the beach for taking photos and selfies, and probably there will be more cruise boats with more people, as they tend to come at the same time, plus the private boats, boat taxis and parachute jumpers.The other option is to take part in a trip which tours only around the Blue Caves and Navagio – such are available from the northern villages. The boats are smaller, the trip takes less and allows you to spend more time on Navagio.','Its important to note that Navagio Beach can be quite busy during peak tourist season, so its a good idea to plan ahead and arrive early in the day to avoid crowds. Additionally, the beach can be dangerous during inclement weather, so its important to be aware of weather conditions and any warnings issued by local authorities.','Navagio is located in the northwest of Zakynthos. The hills varying in height that protect the bay and the beach from high winds add to its uniqueness. The beach is covered in soft and clean cream-colored sand. The rusty contraband ship looks especially epic as a backdrop to this idyllic landscape.The waters here are azure because of the functioning underwater springs. They make the water blue with their minerals and limestone. The sea bottom is covered in grainy white pebbles. The descent and depth rise is smooth, but the water is colder here than on the other beaches of the island.','Its the wonderful landscapes, interesting history and distance from civilization that make Navagio one of the most attracting places of the island. Tourists come here to relax, but also to look at this natural beauty and to take many colorful photographs.','The beach is temporarily closed due to the recent events that happened in September 2018 (rock collapse at the bay). You can still book a tour, but you wont be able to get to the beach or the rocks. If you want the full experience, book a one-day sea tour around the island which includes visiting the Blue caves.Overall, Navagio Beach is a must-see destination for anyone visiting Zakynthos and offers visitors a truly unforgettable experience in one of Greeces most beautiful natural settings.'],

        desc:['3rd century BC e.','"an unbending mighty force, an insurmountable barrier" 长城','The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications, totaling more than 13,000 miles in length, located in northern China. Perhaps the most recognizable symbol of China and its long and vivid history, the Great Wall was originally conceived by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century B.C. as a means of preventing incursions from barbarian nomads. The best-known and best-preserved section of the Great Wall was built in the 14th through 17th centuries A.D., during the Ming dynasty. Though the Great Wall never effectively prevented invaders from entering China, it came to function as a powerful symbol of Chinese civilization’s enduring strength.','Though the beginning of the Great Wall of China can be traced to the fifth century B.C., many of the fortifications included in the wall date from hundreds of years earlier, when China was divided into a number of individual kingdoms during the so-called Warring States Period.','Around 220 B.C., Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China under the Qin Dynasty, ordered that earlier fortifications between states be removed and a number of existing walls along the northern border be joined into a single system that would extend for more than 10,000 li (a li is about one-third of a mile) and protect China against attacks from the north.Construction of the “Wan Li Chang Cheng,” or 10,000-Li-Long Wall, was one of the most ambitious building projects ever undertaken by any civilization. The famous Chinese general Meng Tian initially directed the project, and was said to have used a massive army of soldiers, convicts and commoners as workers.','Made mostly of earth and stone, the wall stretched from the China Sea port of Shanhaiguan over 3,000 miles west into Gansu province. In some strategic areas, sections of the wall overlapped for maximum security (including the Badaling stretch, north of Beijing, that was later restored during the Ming Dynasty).From a base of 15 to 50 feet, the Great Wall rose some 15-30 feet high and was topped by ramparts 12 feet or higher; guard towers were distributed at intervals along it.With the death of Qin Shi Huang and the fall of the Qin Dynasty, much of the Great Wall fell into disrepair. After the fall of the later Han Dynasty, a series of frontier tribes seized control in northern China. The most powerful of these was the Northern Wei Dynasty, which repaired and extended the existing wall to defend against attacks from other tribes.The Bei Qi kingdom (550–577) built or repaired more than 900 miles of wall, and the short-lived but effective Sui Dynasty (581–618) repaired and extended the Great Wall of China a number of times.During the Song Dynasty, the Chinese were forced to withdraw under threat from the Liao and Jin peoples to the north, who took over many areas on both sides of the Great Wall. The powerful Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty (1206-1368), established by Genghis Khan, eventually controlled all of China, parts of Asia and sections of Europe.Between the 18th and 20th centuries, the Great Wall emerged as the most common emblem of China for the Western world, and a symbol both physical – as a manifestation of Chinese strength – and a psychological representation of the barrier maintained by the Chinese state to repel foreign influences and exert control over its citizens.','The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall that runs across northern China, stretching over 13,000 miles. It was originally built over 2,000 years ago by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, as a way to protect against invasions by northern nomadic tribes.Over the centuries, the wall was rebuilt and extended by various Chinese dynasties, including the Han, Sui, and Ming dynasties. The wall was made of a variety of materials, including brick, tamped earth, and stone, and was up to 26 feet high and 39 feet wide in some places.','Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall is not a single continuous wall, but rather a series of walls and fortifications built along strategic points in northern China. These fortifications include walls, watchtowers, and beacon towers, and were used to signal warnings of approaching enemies.','Today, the Great Wall is a popular tourist attraction, with sections of the wall open to visitors for hiking and sightseeing. Some of the most popular sections of the wall include Badaling, Mutianyu, and Jinshanling.Today, the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in human history. In 1987, UNESCO designated the Great Wall a World Heritage site, and a popular claim emerged in the 20th century that it is the only manmade structure visible from space (NASA has since refuted this claim).Overall, the Great Wall of China is an impressive feat of engineering and a testament to the long history of Chinese civilization.'],

They were the first to document the power of the Colorado River, understand the immense size of Grand Canyon, and share its beauty and danger with the world. Their adventures still inspire explorers today.The first Europeans to see Grand Canyon were soldiers led by García López de Cárdenas. In 1540, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado and his Spanish army traveled northward from Mexico City in search of the Seven Cities of Cíbola. After traveling for six months, Coronado’s army arrived at the Hopi Mesas, east of Grand Canyon. Cárdenas, guided by the Hopi, led a small party of men to find a reported “great river.” Coronado hoped to find a navigable river that would serve as a waterway to the Gulf of California. The Hopi leaders advised their men to guide the unwelcome soldiers along an exaggerate path to the highest point above the river and to volunteer no information of value.','After a twenty-day journey, Cárdenas and his army arrived at the edge of the Grand Canyon. Approximately a mile down was the Colorado River below them. The Spaniards estimated that the opposite rim was 8 to 10 miles away and that the Colorado River was no more than 6 feet across. Cárdenas ordered three infantry men to climb their way down to the river. The men made it down to about 1,5000 feet, a third of the way down, until they saw that the Colorado River was much wider waterway than they had estimated and that there was no way to navigate ships along these intense river.Cárdenas party spent three days looking for water and trying to reach the bottom of the river. The Hopi were able to fool the Spaniards into thinking that the area was an impenetrable wasteland and was not navigable anyway. Due to this response, Coronado dismissed further western exploration, and moved his men out east to Texas. The Grand Canyon was left unexplored for 235 years.','Grand Canyon was the last largely unexplored area of the West in 1857. Often called "The Great Unknown" it was literally a blank space on maps. It was known that the Colorado River made a significant portion of its journey through this area, so the federal government funded an expedition to explore the river and determine its usefulness as a trade route.Army First Lieutenant Joseph Christmas Ives of the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers would embark on this challenge and become the first European American known to reach the river within Grand Canyon.','Joseph Christmas Ives would navigate up river using a fifty-foot long sternwheel steamboat, the Explorer. His plan was to steam up the Colorado River from the known into the unknown. However, he crashed just below Black Canyon, not yet in Grand Canyon itself, but continued upriver for another thirty miles in a skiff. Continuing on foot, his overland journey took him down into the canyon at Diamond Creek, today part of the Hualapai Indian Reservation.','It wasn’t until 1869 that another explorer would take on the Colorado River through Grand Canyon. John Wesley Powell was a geologist whose studies of rocks in Colorado and Wyoming sparked his interest in exploring the unknown canyon of the Colorado River. He studied reports from Ives’ expedition, gathered support and supplies from the Smithsonian Institution, railroads, educational institutions, and convinced Congress to authorize the use of rations and supplies from army posts. He designed his own boats and gathered a makeshift crew of ex-trappers, mountain men, and Civil War veterans like himself. The expedition launched four boats from Green River, Wyoming in May 24, 1869.','Today, the Grand Canyon is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year. Visitors can explore the canyon by hiking, rafting, or taking guided tours. The most popular viewpoints include the South Rim, which is open year-round, and the North Rim, which is only open from mid-May to mid-October. The Grand Canyon is also a popular destination for stargazing due to its remote location and dark skies.','The Grand Canyon is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site and is protected by the National Park Service. The park covers over 1.2 million acres (4,926 sq km) and is home to numerous plant and animal species, including bighorn sheep, coyotes, and California condors. The park also includes several important archaeological sites, including ancient Puebloan cliff dwellings and rock art sites.In conclusion, the Grand Canyon is an awe-inspiring natural wonder with a rich geological and human history. It is a popular destination for tourists from around the world and is an important site for conservation and research.'],

        desc:['"waterfall of the deepest place"', '1933','Angel Falls, also known as Salto Ángel, is a breathtaking natural wonder located in Canaima National Park, Venezuela. It is the worlds highest uninterrupted waterfall, with a height of 979 meters (3,212 feet) and a plunge of 807 meters (2,648 feet).',' The waterfall drops over the edge of the Auyán-tepui mountain in the Canaima National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Canaima), a UNESCO World Heritage site in the Gran Sabana region of Bolívar State. The height figure, 979 m (3,212 ft), mostly consists of the main plunge but also includes about 400 metres (1,300 ft) of sloped cascade and rapids below the drop and a 30-metre-high (100 ft) plunge downstream of the talus rapids.The falls are along a fork of the Río Kerepacupai Merú which flows into the Churún River, a tributary of the Carrao River, itself a tributary of the Orinoco River.','Sir Walter Raleigh, in his expedition to find the fabled city of El Dorado, described what was possibly a tepui (table top mountain), and he is said to have been the first European to view Angel Falls, although these claims are considered far-fetched. Some historians state that the first European to visit the waterfall was Fernando de Berrío, a Spanish explorer and governor from the 16th and 17th centuries. Other sources state that the first Westerner to see the waterfall was the Spanish explorer Fèlix Cardona in 1927.They were not known to the outside world until American aviator Jimmie Angel, following directions given by Cardona, flew over them on 16 November 1933 on a flight while he was searching for a valuable ore bed.','Returning on 9 October 1937, Angel tried to land his Flamingo monoplane El Río Caroní atop Auyán-tepui, but the plane was damaged when the wheels sank into the marshy ground. Angel and his three companions, including his wife Marie, were forced to descend the tepui on foot. It took them 11 days to make their way back to civilization by the gradually sloping back side, but news of their adventure spread and the waterfall was named Angel Falls in his honor. The name of the waterfall—"Salto del Ángel"—was first published on a Venezuelan government map in December 1939.Angels plane remained on top of the tepui for 33 years before being lifted out by helicopter. It was restored at the Aviation Museum in Maracay and now sits outdoors on the front of the airport at Ciudad Bolívar.','The first recorded European to reach the base of the falls was the Latvian explorer Aleksandrs Laime, also known as Alejandro Laime to the native Pemon tribe. He reached the falls alone in 1946. He was the first to reach the upper side of the falls in the late 1950s, by climbing up the back side, where the slope is not vertical. He also reached Angels plane 18 years after the crash landing. On 18 November 1955, Latvian independence day, he announced to the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional that this stream without any known local name should be named after a Latvian river, Gauja. The same year, this name was registered in the National Cartographic Institution of Venezuela. There is no convincing proof that the indigenous Pemon people had named the local streams, as Auyán-tepui was considered to be a dangerous place and was not visited by the indigenous people. However, lately the Pemon name Kerep is used as well.','The official height of the falls was determined by a survey carried out by an expedition organized and financed by American journalist Ruth Robertson on 13 May 1949. Robertsons expedition, which began on 23 April 1949, was also the first to reach the foot of the falls. The first known attempt to climb the face of the cliff was made in 1968 during the wet season. It failed because of slippery rock. In 1969, a second attempt was made during the dry season. This attempt was thwarted by lack of water and an overhang 120 metres (400 ft) from the top. The first climb to the top of the cliff was completed on 13 January 1971. The climbers, a four-man team led by American mountaineer George Bogel, an electrical engineer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, required nine and a half days to ascend and one and a half days to rappel down','The best time to visit Angel Falls is during the rainy season, from May to November, when the falls are at their most spectacular. Visitors can take a boat trip up the Carrao River to the base of the falls, and then hike to a lookout point for a stunning view of the cascading water.The surrounding area is home to an abundance of wildlife, including monkeys, jaguars, and over 500 species of birds. Visitors can also learn about the indigenous Pemon people, who have lived in the region for centuries and offer guided tours of their villages and culture.Due to its remote location and difficult access, visiting Angel Falls can be a challenging and expensive experience. However, the awe-inspiring beauty of the falls and the surrounding wilderness make it a once-in-a-lifetime destination for nature lovers and adventure seekers.'],

Construction began in 1868 and was never completed.','Louis II spent much of his childhood at Hohenschwangau Castle, a neo-Gothic, medieval-inspired castle elaborately decorated with scenes from legend and poetry. After his accession to the throne in 1864, Louis set out to build a “New Hohenschwangau Castle”—as Neuschwanstein was called until after his death—which he intended to be an even better reproduction of a medieval-style castle in line with his fairy-tale vision of monarchy. The Romanesque designs were drawn by scene painter Christian Jank, and these were translated into architectural plans by Eduard Riedel. In 1874 Riedel was succeeded as chief architect by Georg von Dollmann, who in turn was succeeded by Julius Hofmann in 1886.','Neuschwanstein stands on the site of two smaller castles, the ruins of which were cleared away in 1868. The foundation stone for Neuschwanstein was laid in September 1869. Although Louis expected the entire project to be completed within three years, only the gateway building was inhabitable by 1873. The topping-out ceremony was held on January 29, 1880, but even then the castle was still under construction. The technical fittings were completed some four and a half years later, and the castle remained incomplete in 1886, when Louis died by drowning himself. He had lived there, off and on, only some six months in total. Several weeks after his passing, the unfinished castle was opened to the public as a museum. Simplified versions of the castle’s bower and square tower were not completed until 1892, and only about a dozen rooms were ever finished.','Neuschwanstein is known as a castle of paradox. It was built in a time when castles were no longer necessary as strongholds, and, despite its romanticized medieval design, Louis also required it to have all the newest technological comforts. The lavish structure is complete with a walled courtyard, an indoor garden, spires, towers, and an artificial cave. In contrast to the medieval castles it was modeled after, Neuschwanstein is equipped with running water throughout, including flush toilets and hot water in the kitchen and baths, and has a forced-air central heating system. The dining room is serviced by an elevator from the kitchen three stories below. Louis even made sure the castle was connected to telephone lines, although at the time of its construction very few people had telephones.','In keeping with its romantic design, the castle’s two-story throne room—which still did not contain a throne at the time of Louis’s death—is modeled after a Byzantine basilica; stars decorate its blue vaulted ceiling, which is supported by red porphyry columns. Louis was a patron of Richard Wagner, and wall paintings throughout the castle depict the legends that inspired the composer: the life of Parsifal in the fourth-floor Singers’ Hall; the Tannhäuser saga in the study; and Lohengrin in the great parlour. Despite remaining unfinished, Neuschwanstein Castle became one of the most popular tourist attractions in Europe, receiving about 1.3 million visitors each year. It also served as inspiration for Disneyland’s Sleeping Beauty Castle.','Neuschwanstein Castle was designed by Christian Jank, a set designer, and was inspired by the romanticized Middle Ages and the operas of Richard Wagner, whom King Ludwig II admired greatly. The castles interior is opulent, featuring intricate woodwork, paintings, and tapestries.','Today, Neuschwanstein Castle is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Germany, attracting millions of visitors each year. Visitors can take guided tours of the castle and its grounds, and there are also several hiking trails in the surrounding area.'],

        desc:['wild life...','1961','Maasai Mara, also sometimes spelled Masai Mara and locally known simply as The Mara, is a large national game reserve in Narok, Kenya, contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. It is named in honor of the Maasai people, the ancestral inhabitants of the area, who migrated to the area from the Nile Basin. Their description of the area when looked at from afar: "Mara" means "spotted" in the local Maasai language, due to the many short bushy trees which dot the landscape.','When it was originally established in 1961 as a wildlife sanctuary the Mara covered only 520 km2 (200 sq mi) of the current area, including the Mara Triangle. The area was extended to the east in 1961 to cover 1,821 km2 (703 sq mi) and converted to a Game Reserve. The Narok County Council (NCC) took over management of the reserve at this time. Part of the reserve was given National Reserve status in 1974, and the remaining area of 159 km2 (61 sq mi) was returned to local communities. An additional 162 km2 (63 sq mi) were removed from the reserve in 1976, and the park was reduced to 1,510 km2 (580 sq mi) in 1984.In 1994, the TransMara County Council (TMCC) was formed in the western part of the reserve, and control was divided between the new council and the existing Narok County Council. In May 2001, the not-for-profit Mara Conservancy took over management of the Mara Triangle which covers the western part of the reserve.','The Maasai people make up a community that spans across northern, central and southern Kenya and northern parts of Tanzania. As pastoralists, the community holds the belief that they own all of the cattle in the world. The Maasai rely off of their lands to sustain their cattle, as well as themselves and their families. Prior to the establishment of the reserve as a protected area for the conservation of wildlife and wilderness, the Maasai were forced to move out of their native lands.','Tradition continues to play a major role in the lives of modern-day Maasai people, who are known for their tall stature, patterned shukas and beadwork. It is estimated that there are approximately half a million individuals that speak the Maa language and this number includes not only the Maasai but also Samburu and Camus people in Kenya.','Masai Mara, also known as Maasai Mara, is a large game reserve in southwestern Kenya, bordering Tanzania. It is named after the Masai people and the Mara River, which runs through the reserve.The Masai Mara is known for its spectacular wildlife and is considered one of the best places in Africa to see the "Big Five" game animals: lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, and rhinoceros. It is also home to many other species, including cheetahs, hyenas, zebras, giraffes, and wildebeests.Every year, from July to October, the Masai Mara is the site of the famous wildebeest migration, where millions of wildebeests and other grazing animals travel from the Serengeti in Tanzania to the Masai Mara in search of food and water. This is a popular time to visit the reserve and witness this natural phenomenon.','In addition to its wildlife, the Masai Mara is also known for its rich cultural heritage. The Masai people, who have lived in the area for centuries, are known for their unique way of life and are often seen herding their cattle along the reserves open plains.Visitors to the Masai Mara can enjoy a variety of activities, including game drives, guided walks, hot air balloon safaris, and cultural visits to Masai villages. There are also a number of lodges and campsites within the reserve, offering a range of accommodation options.','The Masai Mara is easily accessible by road or air, with several daily flights from Nairobi to the reserves main airstrip. It is important to note that the Masai Mara is a protected area, and visitors are required to follow certain rules and regulations to help preserve the reserves unique ecosystem.The Maasai Mara is one of the most famous safari destinations in Africa.[17] Entry fees are currently US$ 70 for adult non-East African Residents per 24 hours (if staying at a property inside the Reserve) or US$80 if outside the reserve, and $40 for children.[18] There are a number of lodges and tented camps catering for tourists inside or bordering the Reserve and within the various separate Conservancies which border the main reserve.

Otherwise, little was known of the Namib until the latter part of the 19th century. After South West Africa was established as a colony of Germany in the early 1890s, the German military began detailed exploration and mapping of the desert.Namib, Portuguese Namibe, a cool coastal desert extending for 1,200 miles (1,900 km) along the Atlantic coast of Africa from Namibe (formerly Moçâmedes) in Angola southward across Namibia to the Olifants River in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It reaches inland 80 to 100 miles (130 to 160 km) to the foot of the Great Escarpment. The southern portion merges with the Kalahari on the plateau atop the escarpment. Its name is derived from the Nama language, implying “an area where there is nothing.”','The Namib is arid and is almost totally uninhabited, except for a small number of scattered towns. It is important because of the trade routes that cross it, its mineral deposits, the fisheries of the bordering sea, and its increasing utilization for recreational purposes.','The Namib is divided into three successive north–south-trending strips: the very narrow coastal region along the Atlantic, strongly subject to marine influences; the Outer Namib, occupying the rest of the western half of the desert; and the Inner Namib, constituting the eastern portion. The boundaries between them consist of broad transition zones.The desert basically consists of a relatively smooth platform of truncated bedrock of various types and ages. Mica-schist and other metamorphics and granite and similar intrusives predominate. The platform rises gradually from the coast to about 3,000 feet (900 metres) at the foot of the Great Escarpment. Scattered isolated mountains rise steeply and abruptly above the platform, and in the northern half several streams have carved deep steep-walled gorges into it.','In much of the southern half of the desert the platform is surmounted by a vast expanse of sand—yellow-gray near the coast and brick red inland—which is derived from the Orange River and from other rivers that flow westward from the escarpment but never reach the sea. The dunes run in lines from north-northwest to south-southeast, individual dunes having lengths of 10 to 20 miles (16 to 32 km) and reaching heights of 200 to 800 feet (60 to 240 metres). The troughs between these lines of dunes are interrupted by smaller transverse dunes. The extreme southern coastal area consists of wind-scoured bedrock and a few rapidly moving crescent-shaped barchans (i.e., dunes convex to the wind). The northern third—the Kaokoveld region—consists of gravel plains and rock platforms occurring between scattered rugged mountains, interspersed with a few large dune fields.','The Namib Desert is known for its unique landscapes and ecosystems, characterized by towering sand dunes, vast gravel plains, rugged mountains, and rocky coastlines. The dunes are among the highest in the world, with some reaching up to 300 meters in height. The desert is also home to a variety of plants and animals that have adapted to survive in its harsh and arid environment, including desert-adapted elephants, lions, and rhinos.One of the most iconic locations in the Namib Desert is Sossusvlei, a salt and clay pan surrounded by red sand dunes. It is a popular tourist destination and a photographers dream, with its stunning vistas and otherworldly landscapes.','The Namib Desert is also rich in mineral resources, including diamonds, uranium, and copper. Despite its harsh conditions, it is also home to several indigenous communities, such as the Himba and Herero people, who have lived in the region for thousands of years.','At the coast there is little difference in temperature between day and night or between winter and summer. Temperatures are usually between 50 and 60 °F (10 and 16 °C). Along the inland margins, summer temperatures normally reach the upper 80s F (low 30s C). Only in areas sheltered from the cooling sea breeze (lee sides of mountains and bottoms of canyons) do temperatures frequently approach those expected in low-latitude deserts—i.e., in excess of 100 °F (38 °C). Freezing temperatures occur occasionally along the inner edge of the desert. A few days each year, usually in fall or spring, berg (mountain) winds blowing from the east bring high temperatures (above 100 °F), together with dry air and clouds of dust, across the desert to the coast itself. The rare rains occur usually as short-lived torrential thunderstorms.Due to its unique ecology and biodiversity, the Namib Desert has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as an Important Bird Area and a Global 200 ecoregion. However, the desert is also threatened by human activities such as mining, overgrazing, and tourism, which can cause irreversible damage to its fragile ecosystems.'],

Magellan, like Columbus, was a supporter of the idea that the Earth is round, therefore, traveling to the west will lead to the east.','The expedition was staffed by a large team (about 265-280 people) on five ships. However, as a result of rebellions, the difficult crossing of the Pacific Ocean, conflicts with the population of the Philippines and the Spice Islands, the expedition team was greatly reduced. The ship "Victoria" returned to Spain with 18 people on board, and another 18 people who were captured by the Portuguese returned to Europe later.Since school days, many people know that Ferdinand Magellan is a famous navigator, however, few people know how he ended up at the head of a large Spanish expedition around the world. Being a Portuguese from an impoverished noble family, Magellan was a member of many of the most important Portuguese expeditions to India and Malaysia, where he was repeatedly wounded. Some historians and bibliographers say that Magellan was lame in one leg. For eight years, the future navigator served in the Portuguese Navy, gaining a reputation as a brave sailor. When the Portuguese king denied Magellan a promotion, Fernand joined the Spanish Council of the Indies, an institution in Seville that dealt with newly discovered lands. Thus, Magellan declared that the Moluccas, also known as the Spice Islands, should belong to Spain.','So, Ferdinand Magellan himself sailed on the Trinidad ship. The ship "San Antonio" was led by the famous Juan Cartagena. He, like other leaders of the flotilla - the Spaniards, was dissatisfied with the fact that the Portuguese was at the head of the expedition. During the journey, Magellan and Cartagena regularly have violent conflicts. As a result of one of them, Magellan removed Cartagena from his post, whom the King of Spain himself personally appointed as the royal controller of the expedition.The purpose of the expedition of Magellan and his team was commercial - to find the shortest route to the Spice Islands and force them to submit to the Spanish crown. Indeed, the expedition proved to be very successful in this regard and brought the organizers a lot of profit.For four months, the expedition reached the shores of South America. And soon she sailed to the bay, and not the strait leading to the South Sea. For another three months, the team members tried to find the coveted strait - the flotilla followed the captain bypassed the previously unknown Atlantic coast of South America.','Soon Magellan and the remaining members of the expedition rounded the southernmost point of the South American continent - Cape Froward, which is located on the Brunswick Peninsula, and then sailed northwest for another five days. It seemed that the shores were deserted, however, at night you could see the fires of fires. Therefore, Magellan called this southern territory the "Land of Fire" - the modern Tierra del Fuego.Finally, the desired strait was found and named Magellan. The weather was favorable, so when the team went out into the ocean, it was called Pacific. However, daily life on the flotillas was not so rosy - the whole crew suffered from scurvy, 19 people died from harsh conditions.','In March 1521, the ships reached the Mariana Islands, and later reached the Philippines - this meant the end of the passage across the Pacific Ocean.In April 1521, Magellans expedition enters the Philippine port of Cebu. So, active trade begins between Europeans and the local population. Many, including Raja Humabon, were impressed by the strength and equipment of the Europeans, agreeing to become subjects of the Spanish crown. However, the leader of one of the islands, Mactan, opposes the new order. Then Magellan, who wants to show the strength and power of the Spanish weapons, decides to teach Mactan a lesson. However, the natives attacked Europeans unprepared for battle, as a result of which many sailors died, and most importantly, Ferdinand Magellan. After some time, a monument to the great Magellan will be erected on the island, and next to it is another one - to the leader of the islanders, from whose hand the expedition leader died.','On December 21, the crew of the ship Victoria, under the command of Juan Sebastian Elcano, set off for home. And in 1081 days, the first ever circumnavigation of the world was completed. The expedition found out that most of the earths surface is not land, as Columbus and his contemporaries thought, but water. In addition, Spain received the "right of first discovery" to the Mariana and Philippine Islands. Two star clusters (Large and Small Magellanic Clouds) and a strait are named after Magellan','The surviving crew members, led by Juan Sebastian Elcano, continued the journey with the remaining two ships, the Trinidad and the Victoria. They sailed across the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and reached the Atlantic Ocean in July 1522. They arrived in Seville, Spain, on September 6, 1522, completing the first circumnavigation of the globe. Only 18 crew members, all from the Victoria, survived the journey.The expeditions impact on navigation and cartography was significant. It proved that the earth was round and that the Pacific was an ocean of vast size. It also opened up new trade routes between Europe and Asia, leading to the development of a global economy. The expedition contributed to the advancement of astronomy, geography, and cartography, as well as the discovery of new lands and peoples.'],

        desc:['"a period of rebellion, rum, treasure and sea robberies"','1690-1730','The Golden Age of Piracy (1690-1730) refers to a period when robbery on the high seas and at colonial ports reached an unprecedented level. Although not all historians agree on the precise time frame, it is generally applied to those pirates who operated in the Caribbean, the east coast of America, the eastern Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean.Infamous names associated with the period include Captain Kidd (d. 1701), Blackbeard (d. 1718), and Bartholomew Roberts (d. 1722). These men, and some women like Anne Bonny and Mary Read, targetted merchant shipping and, much more rarely, well-armed treasure ships. The period ended when the Royal Navy, the British East India Company, and colonial governors took a much more active and aggressive stance against piracy, resulting in the capture and public hanging of hundreds of pirates from London to the Carolinas.','The "Golden Age of Piracy" is rather an odd name to attach to a period when crime was rife, but this is of secondary concern to the problem of defining what exactly this period covers. Most historians would not include the period of the buccaneers who targetted the Spanish Main and treasure ships earlier in the 17th century (c. 1650-1680). The close of that century is the most common starting point of the Golden Age for scholars, but some would restrict it to the first two or three decades, or even only the second decade of the 18th century. Here, then, in order not to omit certain points of interest pertinent to the subject of piracy, we will adopt a wider view and treat the "Golden Age" as being approximately 1690 to 1730. It is also important to note that piracy has been conducted since antiquity and is still ongoing in many parts of the world so that an insistence on specific time frames is inherently problematic: piracy, it seems, has neither a starting nor a finishing point.','Finally, there is, too, a question of geography. While piracy in our period was rife in many other parts of the world, the term "Golden Age" in this context is usually restricted to those pirates who operated on either side of the Atlantic Ocean, in the Indian Ocean. and off the coast of West Africa. Pirates such as those on the Barbary Coast and in East Asia are usually treated separately. The majority of the pirates in the Golden Age, therefore, are British or American, but there were significant numbers of other nationalities involved, notably Dutch and French, and pirate crews could, in fact, include anyone from just about anywhere, including former African slaves and indigenous peoples.The question remains why piracy flourished in this particular period. Men and some women were tempted into a life of piracy by the harshness of life at sea on a merchant or naval vessel - the vast majority of pirates were experienced seamen - or because they could not find meaningful employment following the end of the wars between England and France. Following the Age of Exploration, the European colonies beyond the Mediterranean were now blossoming. These were communities growing in size and wealth and with a corresponding increase in merchant shipping to serve them. There was still, though, a lack of firm governance and military protection so far from the home nation so that many ports and ships were easy targets for pirates who cared not for the consequences of their crimes.','While some pirate crew members have gained fame (or infamy) in their own right, the names most strongly attached to the period are those of captains. While most pirates wore the clothing that any other type of mariner wore, the captains were more wont to make a fashion statement and wear the flashy apparel the gentry of the period sported. Bartholomew Roberts (aka "Black Bart "Roberts) was famous for wearing a scarlet silk coat, a matching damask waistcoat, and a diamond necklace. Blackbeard (aka Edward Teach) wore black ribbons in his beard, carried six pistols, and had lit fuses under his hat whenever he went into battle. Doubtless, these pirate captains were keen to create a legend about themselves that helped make sure a target vessel surrendered immediately and their own crews remained loyal.','Other captains went for a more brutal approach to gaining notoriety. Charles Vane (hanged 1721) once fired his cannons at the ship of the governor of the Bahamas, while Edward Low amassed a long list of heinous crimes such as mutilating, burning, and hanging his victims between 1721 and 1724. Captain Stede Bonnet (hanged 1718), the "Gentleman Pirate", was unusual because he chose a life of piracy as a change of pace from running his own plantation in Barbados. Piracy, it seems, attracted all sorts.Finally, there are those pirates who were not particularly famous in their day but who have since grabbed the public’s imagination for one reason or another. Captain John Rackham (aka "Calico Jack", hanged 1720) was a small-time pirate now famous for his crew members of Anne Bonny and Mary Read, as well as his Jolly Roger with its crossed cutlasses. Captain Benjamin Hornigold (d. 1719) was notable for giving up piracy and becoming, instead, a pirate hunter for the governor of the Bahamas. Captain Samuel Bellamy died in relative anonymity in 1717 when his ship Whydah was sunk in a storm off Cape Cod, but his name has been revived following the underwater exploration of this wreck and its invaluable contribution to our knowledge of Golden Age pirates, their loot, and their ships.','Although novels and films often have pirates sailing large galleon-type ships, the reality during the Golden Age was rather different. The vast majority of pirates preferred something like a sloop, which was fast, highly manoeuvrable, and capable of sailing through shallows where larger naval ships could not follow. In addition, pirates typically went after easy targets such as merchant vessels armed with no more than a handful of cannons. However, there were some notable exceptions as some pirates preferred a larger ship capable of matching a lower-rated naval vessel in firepower. Prestige was also a factor, and it is significant that the more notorious and successful pirates did possess the largest ships.Captain Kidd sailed the purpose-built Adventure Galley. This was a 287-ton three-masted ship, which could pursue a target in all conditions thanks to its mix of square-rigged sails, lateen sail (triangular), and banks of oars (46 in total). The Adventure Galley was crewed by over 150 men and was well-armed with 34 cannons. Edward England captured a fine ship off Madagascar in 1720, which he renamed the Fancy. This vessel also boasted 34 cannons and had a crew of around 180 men.Perhaps the most famous of pirate ships is Blackbeard’s Queen Anne’s Revenge, another captured vessel, this time a French slaver. The Queen Anne’s Revenge had a crew of at least 300 men, necessary to man the 40 cannons on board. The most powerful pirate ship of all in this period was Bartholomew Roberts’ Royal Fortune. The former French warship bristled with at least 42 cannons, and Roberts used it well, adapting it for speed and becoming the most successful of all Golden Age pirates in terms of ships captured, well over 400.','The old days of letting off most pirate crews with a flogging as a warning and hanging only the captain were over. Now, entire crews were being brought to justice in show trials that ended in mass executions. In 1722 at Cape Coast Castle, Guinea in West Africa, 52 of Bartholomew Roberts’ crew were hanged in one day. At places like Execution Dock in Wapping, London, or Deadman’s Cay near Port Royal, the sight of hanged pirates swaying in the sea breeze became a familiar one to locals and passing ships. The most notorious pirates had their corpses hung in an iron cage, left to rot in the open air for one or two years. Even those who escaped the death sentence often only had their fate delayed as they were either given lengthy sentences in disease-ridden prisons or transported to penal colonies for a short sharp life of hard labour.iracy was never entirely stamped out, it is, after all, one of those crimes that seems to have always bedevilled humanity. However, as colonies came to establish themselves with more robust institutions of government and justice, so more people had a cause to see the end of piracy. Even the pirates themselves, those who had escaped the hangman’s noose, often settled down to a more respectable living on plantations or operated as honest merchants, the very targets they had once terrorized.'],
